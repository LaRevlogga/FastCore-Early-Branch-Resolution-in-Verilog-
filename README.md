# FastCore-Early-Branch-Resolution-in-Verilog-
This project implements an early branch resolution mechanism in Verilog using a fast pre-execution core. Simple, dependency-ready instructions are speculatively executed ahead of the main pipeline, allowing branch outcomes to be resolved earlier and reducing branch misprediction penalty in pipelined processors.
